    "\n",
    "In this project, we’ll use **Gemma 3* (1B), a small but capable open-weight model, and run it entirely on your local machine using Ollama. This means you won’t need API keys or internet access to generate responses once the model is downloaded.\n",

    "**What is Ollama?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ollama is a lightweight runtime for managing and serving open-weight LLMs locally. It provides:\n",
    "* A simple REST API running at localhost:11434, so your code can interact with the model via standard HTTP calls.\n",
    "* A model registry and command-line tool** to pull, run, and manage models easily.\n",
    "* Support for a wide variety of models (e.g., Gemma, Llama, Mistral, Phi, etc.), making it ideal for experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about Ollama, visit: https://github.com/ollama/ollama. You can browse all supported models and their sizes here: https://ollama.com/library\n",

    "**2 - Start the Ollama server (keep this terminal open)**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ollama serve\n",
    "```\n",
    "This command launches a local server at http://localhost:11434, which will stay running in the background.\n",
    "\n",

    "**3 - Pull the Gemma mode (or the model of your choice) in a new terminal**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ollama pull gemma3:1b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This downloads the 1B version of Gemma 3, a compact model suitable for running on most modern laptops. Once downloaded, Ollama will automatically handle model loading and caching.\n",
